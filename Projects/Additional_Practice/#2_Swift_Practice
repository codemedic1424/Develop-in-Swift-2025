This file can be imported directly into Xcode, GitHub, or Atlas.

## 🧩 PART 1 — Binding Exercises

### **Exercise B1 — Editable Username**
Create a view with:
- `@State private var username = ""`
- A `TextField` bound to `$username`
- A `Text` label that updates live as you type  
- Bonus: Create a child view that edits the username through a `Binding<String>`.

---

### **Exercise B2 — Online/Offline Toggle**
Create:
- `@State private var isOnline = false`
- A toggle bound to `$isOnline`
- A label showing `"Online"` or `"Offline"`  
- Bonus: Move the toggle into a child view using a binding.

---

### **Exercise B3 — Shared Slider and Stepper**
Create:
- `@State private var volume = 50`
- A slider and a stepper bound to the same value  
- A label showing the value

---

## 🧮 PART 2 — Computed Property Exercises

### **Exercise C1 — Temperature Range**
Create a struct:
```swift
struct DayTemperature {
    var low: Int
    var high: Int
    var range: String { "\(low)–\(high)º" }
}
```

Display `range` inside a Text view.

---

### **Exercise C2 — Progress Model**
```swift
struct ProgressInfo {
    var completed: Int
    var total: Int
    var fraction: Double { Double(completed) / Double(total) }
    var label: String { "\(completed) of \(total)" }
}
```

Render these in a SwiftUI view.

---

### **Exercise C3 — Category Property**
```swift
struct Score {
    var value: Int
    var category: String {
        switch value {
        case ..<50: "Low"
        case 50..<75: "Medium"
        default: "High"
        }
    }
}
```

Use this to change the displayed text color.

---

## 🧱 PART 3 — Struct Modeling Exercises

### **Exercise S1 — Player Model**
```swift
struct Player {
    var name: String
    var score: Int
}
```
Store players in a `@State` array and list them.

---

### **Exercise S2 — Task Model**
```swift
struct Task {
    var title: String
    var isCompleted: Bool
}
```
Display tasks in a list with toggles bound to each task.

---

### **Exercise S3 — Card Model**
```swift
struct Card {
    var title: String
    var detail: String
    var isFavorite: Bool
}
```
Render the cards in a styled VStack.

---

# 🚀 PART 4 — Combined Mini-Project  
## **Score Tracker App**

### **Phase 1 — Editable Player List**
Create:
```swift
struct Player: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var score: Int
}
```

Store `[Player]` in `@State` and display:
- Editable name field (`TextField`)  
- Score adjustment controls (`Button` or `Stepper`)

---

### **Phase 2 — Computed Properties in the Model**
Add:
```swift
var isHighScore: Bool { score >= 50 }
var status: String { isHighScore ? "Leading" : "Behind" }
```

Use these to:
- Color code the score  
- Display the player status  

---

### **Phase 3 — Overall Game Summary**
Add computed properties in the view:
- Total score across all players  
- Highest score  
- Current leader  

Display these in a summary section.

---

### **Phase 4 — Stretch Enhancements**
- Add a “New Player” button  
- Add “Reset All Scores”  
- Add a toggle to show/hide players below a threshold  

---
