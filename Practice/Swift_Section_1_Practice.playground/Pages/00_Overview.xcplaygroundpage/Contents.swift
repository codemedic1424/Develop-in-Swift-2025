//: # Swift Section 1 – Practice Playground
//:
//: This playground is for **reinforcing** the concepts from Section 1:
//:
//: - The Basics
//: - Optionals
//: - Collection Types
//: - Control Flow
//: - Functions
//: - Structures & Classes
//: - Value vs Reference Types
//: - Enumerations
//:
//: ## How to use this
//: - Work through each page **in order**.
//: - Type your answers in the provided `// TODO:` sections.
//: - Run the code frequently (⌘ + R).
//: - It’s okay to break things. That’s the point. 😊
//:
//: When you finish a page, check it off in your roadmap README in the repo.
