## 📘 Seek Out the Best View


### 🧭 Overview
- Views are the key component of developing with SwiftUI. SwiftUI uses declaritive programming, which focuses on you writing the desired outcome and swift translate the cod einto a functional UI.  


---

### 🧠 Key Concepts
| Concept | Description | Related Swift Feature |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| structures | organizes related code are packaged together| `struct` |
| views | Text, Image, Stacks - help organize UI | `Image(_:), Text(_:)` |
| modifiers | modifiers alter the view as desired using dot sytax | `.foregroundColor(_:)`|

💡 *Tip:* Use this section to summarize new SwiftUI keywords (`@State`, `@Binding`, `NavigationStack`, etc.) and how they connect to your Swift fundamentals.

📝 *Notes:*  
```
To declare a property, use the let keyword. A property has a name, followed by a colon and then the kind of data it holds. This property’s name is day, and it holds a String.
Note
In Swift, kinds of data are called types. You can read the code you added to the DayForecast structure like this: “day is a property whose type is String.” Or you could say, “day is a property of type String.”
```
